# XcodeTest
Testing Xcode and GitHub

This first method involves creating a repository on GitHub first.
Next you open up Xcode and paste the link into "Clone an existing project" and create a file on your local computer.
Then you create a project in the file you just created. Unchecking the "create git repository box".
This will connect your project with your GitHub repository.
